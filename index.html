				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I am a Software Engineering student, in my third year of studies at Carleton University.
				</p>
				<p>
					I love learning, and take pride in building and fixing things.
					I enjoy solving problems, however they come to me. Whether it's splitting costs with a spreadsheet,
					fixing cars, or writing code, solving problems captivates me, and I believe it is ultimately my fort&#233;.
				</p>
				<p>
					Check out my <label for="resume" class="a">r&#233;sum&#233;</label> and
					<label for="projects" class="a">projects</label> to see how I've used my love of problem-solving in the real world.

			<!-- PROJECTS -->
			<div class="page" id="pr">
				<p>I've worked on some cool projects before, and I'm always taking on new ones.
				See below for a list of the projects I'm most proud of.</p>
				
				<div class="project">
					<h2>Ravens Racing Website</h2>
					<p class="date">Summer 2018 &mdash; present</p>
					<p>When I joined Ravens Racing FSAE at Carleton in 2017, the team's official website was a large Wix site that was hard to navigate, and hard to work on.
					I made it my goal to make a site that looked better, was more thoughtfully laid out, and that still contained all useful information.</p>
					<p>I created the site and launched it (<a target="_blank" href="http://ravensracing.com/">ravensracing.com</a>), and currently update it whenever needed.</p>
					<p>The site features a fade-scrolling effect on the home page, and is mobile-friendly. It was made so that content updates are dynamically
					applied across the whole site, and most content is pulled from easy-to-modify JSON files. The whole site is written in HTML/JavaScript/CSS, with some
					content generated through PHP. No third-party libraries are used.</p>
					<p>The site is a work-in-progress, so I'm currently developing a couple new cool features.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="project">
					<h2>Chipstart</h2>
					<p class="date">Spring 2016</p>
					<p>Chipstart is a web app meant to help kids learn to write simple code. It used a simulated on-screen microchip that would "control" LEDs or a
					7-segment display, and "take input" from toggle switches and/or buttons (all simulated on-screen as well). The idea was that by offering a simple
					visual medium, controlled by a small number of simple commands and elementary math, coding could be made to seem less daunting and easier to learn.</p>
					<p>In the spring of 2017, I submitted to the TechU.Me AppJam (an app competition for high school students), and won a cash prize as well as a scholarship
					to the University of Ottawa!</p>
					<p>The app worked via a JavaScript interpreter (I was not familiar with cloud computing back then) that parsed and executed a syntax of code developed by myself,
					but very similar in syntax to Python. The language was fully documented such that if read from the beginning, users could learn to write it with no prior
					programming experience.</p>
					<p>The app also featured a small number of "challenges" that the user could complete. The users could write and test their code, and when they were ready, they
					could have it "evaluated". The app would check that the code did what it was supposed to, and then give feedback based on the results of running it.</p>
					<p>To date, I am probably most proud of this project. Unfortunately, it isn't live at the moment, but I hope to recreate it with more features (and a more
					elegant solution than an interpreter written in JavaScript). The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/ericcanam/Chipstart">on a repository</a> on my GitHub.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="project">
					<h2>Wittypedia</h2>
					<p class="date">Work In Progress (present)</p>
					<p>Wittypedia will be a phone game similar in style to <i>Cards Against Humanity</i> or <i>Apples to Apples</i>. Players will take turns judging players submissions
					to fill-in-the-blank prompts. What makes this different is that the fill-in-the-blank prompts will be generated using random sentences from Wikipedia.
					A random sentence is picked, and a machine learning model will try to determine where best to put the blank.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="project">
					<h2>Turd Sort</h2>
					<p class="date">Winter 2015</p>
					<p>Turd Sort was my answer to BOGO sort. It uses the same principle as bogo sort: randomize the list until it just happens to be in the correct order.
					Turd Sort improves upon bogo sort by shuffling the list until either the min or max winds up at the front or end of the list. When this happens,
					Turd Sort will keep it there and shuffle the middle of the list, until there are 0 or 1 items left in the middle.</p>
					<p>On average, Turd Sort was <i>way</i> faster than bogo sort, especially at list sizes above 6. Ultimately, though, Turd Sort is useless as a sorting algorithm.
					I think its purpose is to serve as a reminder: an algorithm may be able to be improved, but sometimes it's better to write a new one altogether.</p>
					<p>The Python code can be found <a href="https://github.com/ericcanam/Turd-Sort">on a repository</a> on my GitHub. You can also see graphs of its
					<a href="./projects/turdsort/f2.png" target="_blank">average runtimes</a> over 5,000 trials, and its average
					<a href="./projects/turdsort/f1.png" target="_blank">runtimes compared to bogo sort</a>, also over 5,000 trials.</p>
