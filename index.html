			<!-- PROJECTS -->
			<div class="page" id="pr">
				<p>I've worked on some cool projects before, and I'm always taking on new ones.
				See below for a list of the projects I'm most proud of.</p>
				
				<div class="project">
					<h2>FSAE Driving Simulator</h2>
					<p class="date">October 2019 &mdash; present (work in progress)</p>
					<p>Formula SAE regulations require that space frames be rebuilt every year. This means that when a frame is retired, the team must choose what
					happens to it.</p>
					<p>This year, I decided that the 2018 frame could be used to make a driving simulator. The goal of the simulator is to accurately represent
					the driving dynamics of any ravens racing car by taking input to represent certain parameters. This might include spring/damper rates, tire
					compound, steering points, etc.</p>
					<p>The simulator should be able to simulate changes to suspension design, aero package design, and drivetrain.</p>
					<p>I am currently in the planning phase of the project: researching required sensors, and determining the best way to implement an easily
					parametrized car model that can be imported into an existing racing simulator/game.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="project">
					<h2>Chipstart</h2>
					<p class="date">Spring 2016</p>
					<p>Chipstart is a web app meant to help kids learn to write simple code. It used a simulated on-screen microchip that would "control" LEDs or a
					7-segment display, and "take input" from toggle switches and/or buttons (all simulated on-screen as well). The idea was that by offering a simple
					visual medium, controlled by a small number of simple commands and elementary math, coding could be made to seem less daunting and easier to learn.</p>
					<p>In the spring of 2017, I submitted to the TechU.Me AppJam (an app competition for high school students), and won a cash prize as well as a scholarship
					to the University of Ottawa!</p>
					<p>The app worked via a JavaScript interpreter (I was not familiar with cloud computing back then) that parsed and executed a syntax of code developed by myself,
					but very similar in syntax to Python. The language was fully documented such that if read from the beginning, users could learn to write it with no prior
					programming experience.</p>
					<p>The app also featured a small number of "challenges" that the user could complete. The users could write and test their code, and when they were ready, they
					could have it "evaluated". The app would check that the code did what it was supposed to, and then give feedback based on the results of running it.</p>
					<p>To date, I am probably most proud of this project. Unfortunately, it isn't live at the moment, but I hope to recreate it with more features (and a more
					elegant solution than an interpreter written in JavaScript). The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/ericcanam/Chipstart">on a repository</a> on my GitHub.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="project">
					<h2>Street Buddy</h2>
					<p class="date">Work In Progress (present)</p>
					<p>App that notifies you with text-to-speech if an upcoming road has a user generated report of potholes or otherwise rough road conditions.</p>
					<p>When finished, I will begin to develop an iOS version.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="project">
					<h2>Ravens Racing Website</h2>
					<p class="date">Summer 2018 &mdash; present</p>
					<p>When I joined Ravens Racing FSAE at Carleton in 2017, the team's official website was a large Wix site that was hard to navigate, and hard to work on.
					I made it my goal to make a site that looked better, was more thoughtfully laid out, and that still contained all useful information.</p>
					<p>I created the site and launched it (<a target="_blank" href="http://ravensracing.com/">ravensracing.com</a>), and currently update it whenever needed.</p>
					<p>The site features a fade-scrolling effect on the home page, and is mobile-friendly. It was made so that content updates are dynamically
					applied across the whole site, and most content is pulled from easy-to-modify JSON files. The whole site is written in HTML/JavaScript/CSS, with some
					content generated through PHP. No third-party libraries are used.</p>
					<p>The site is a work-in-progress, so I'm currently developing a couple new cool features.</p>
